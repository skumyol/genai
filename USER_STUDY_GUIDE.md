Welcome!
Thank you for participating in our research study on interactive storytelling. You will be interacting with an AI-powered social simulation called NarrativeHive. Your task is to explore a small virtual town and its inhabitants.

The Goal: Over the course of this session, you will interact with a new AI NPC interaction system. Your goal is to simply explore the world and see what happens. You will interact with a series of AI-driven characters (NPCs) in a virtual world. You can talk to them, ask them questions, and see how they react. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to play. Just follow your curiosity. You need to reveal secrets and relationships between characters. 

Your Task:

You will have to complete two identical sessions with two parts and at the end of each session prompted with a survey. Please note that end survey will include specific questions of your gameplay that the AI will decide how related that are.
How to complete sessions:
1. Click Session 1 part 1
2. Choose an NPC from left sidebar by clicking on "play as" button.
3. Choose an NPC to talk with.
4. Try to reveal relation and personal secret facts from the NPCs. Note it down as you'll be asked for it in the questionnaire. This should be different for each part. 
You will be automatically directed to next sessions as you message with NPCs. For each part there is a maximum number of messages limitation.

Final Survey: At the very end, you will be asked to compare your two experiences and rank them.
Feel free to explore and talk to different characters in the virtual space.
Your identity and your responses are completely confidential.
Talk Naturally: Type what you want to say as if you were having a real conversation (e.g., "Hello Elara, what can you tell me about Thorne?").
Ask About Others: Characters know each other. Feel free to ask one character about another.
Your Actions Matter: How you treat characters may influence how they and others treat you in return.
There are no wrong choices: We are interested in your natural interaction style.
Technical Notes:
All your interactions are anonymized and recorded for research purposes.
Finally:
Please try to immerse yourself in the experience. After each session, you will answer a questionnaire about your experience. There are no trick questions; we want your honest opinion.
